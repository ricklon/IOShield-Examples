These sketches rely on the ChipKit Basc IO Shield from Digilent:
http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,719,935&Prod=CHIPKIT-BASIC-IO-SHIELD

The libraries are from that web page. http://www.digilentinc.com/Data/Products/CHIPKIT-BASIC-IO-SHIELD/ChipKit%20IOShield%20Library.zip

Extract the file then copy the libraries into your arduino/libraries folder or mpide/libraries folder.

This shield is designed for the ChipKit so not all features will work with the shield used in a standard Arduino.

Place these IOSHield Examples into your sketch folder.
